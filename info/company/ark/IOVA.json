Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy uses a patient's own immune cells to attack cancer. TIL cells are extracted from a patient's own tumor tissue, expanded through a proprietary process, and infused back into the patient. Upon infusion, TIL reach tumor tissue, where they attack cancer cells. The company has completed dosing in pivotal programs in patients with metastatic melanoma and cervical cancer. In addition, the company's TIL therapy is being investigated in a registration-supporting study for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Clinical studies are also underway to evaluate TIL in earlier stage cancers in combination with currently approved treatments, and to investigate Iovance peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) T cell therapy for blood cancers.", "CEO": "Maria Fardis", "securityName": "Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc", "issueType": "cs", "sector": "Manufacturing", "primarySicCode": 2836, "employees": null, "tags": ["Health Technology", "Biotechnology", "Manufacturing", "Biological Product (except Diagnostic) Manufacturing "], "address": "999 Skyway Rd Ste 150", "address2": null, "state": "California", "city": "San Carlos", "zip": "94070-2724", "country": "US", "phone": "16502607120"}
