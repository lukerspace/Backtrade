Adaptive Biotechnologies believes the adaptive immune system is nature's most finely tuned diagnostic and therapeutic for most diseases, but the inability to decode it has prevented the medical community from fully leveraging its capabilities. Its proprietary immune medicine platform reveals and translates the massive genetics of the adaptive immune system with scale, precision and speed to develop products in life sciences research, clinical diagnostics, and drug discovery. We have three commercial products, and a robust clinical pipeline to diagnose, monitor and enable the treatment of diseases such as cancer, autoimmune conditions and infectious diseases. Our goal is to develop and commercialize immune-driven clinical products tailored to each individual patient.", "CEO": "Chad Robins", "securityName": "Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp", "issueType": "cs", "sector": "Manufacturing", "primarySicCode": 2836, "employees": null, "tags": ["Commercial Services", "Miscellaneous Commercial Services", "Manufacturing", "Biological Product (except Diagnostic) Manufacturing "], "address": "1551 Eastlake Ave E Ste 200", "address2": null, "state": "Washington", "city": "Seattle", "zip": "98102-7402", "country": "US", "phone": "12066590067"}
