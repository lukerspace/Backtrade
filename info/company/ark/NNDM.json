{"symbol": "NNDM", "companyName": "Nano Dimension Ltd", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "industry": "Bare Printed Circuit Board Manufacturing  ", "website": "www.nano-di.com", "description": "Nano Dimension is a provider of intelligent machines for the fabrication of Additively Manufactured Electronics (AME). High fidelity active electronic and electromechanical subassemblies are integral enablers of autonomous intelligent drones, cars, satellites, smartphones, and in vivo medical devices. They necessitate iterative development, IP safety, fast time-to-market and device performance gains, thereby mandating AME for in-house, rapid prototyping and production. The DragonFly LDM\u00ae system is being deployed in a wide range of industries, including academic and research institutions, defense, aerospace, autonomous automotive, robotics, and biotech. Its ability to enable on-site prototyping in a matter of hours instead of weeks; create products with better performance; reduce the size and weight of electronic parts and devices; enable innovation; and critically important, protect IP, is a paradigm shift in how industry and research institutions will research, develop, and produce High-Performance Electronic Devices (Hi-PEDs\u2122.) Nano Dimension machines serve cross-industry needs by depositing proprietary consumable conductive and dielectric materials simultaneously, while concurrently integrating in-situ capacitors, antennas, coils, transformers and electromechanical components, to function at unprecedented performance. Nano Dimension bridges the gap between PCB and semiconductor integrated circuits. A revolution at the click of a button: From CAD to a functional high-performance AME device in hours, solely at the cost of the consumable materials.", "CEO": "Yoav Stern", "securityName": "Nano Dimension Ltd - ADR", "issueType": "ad", "sector": "Manufacturing", "primarySicCode": 3672, "employees": null, "tags": ["Process Industries", "Textiles", "Producer Manufacturing", "Industrial Machinery", "Manufacturing", "Computer Storage Device Manufacturing "], "address": null, "address2": null, "state": "Ness Ziona", "city": "2 Ilan Ramon St Science Park", "zip": "7403635", "country": "Israel", "phone": null}
